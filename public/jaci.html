<h2> Jaci's page </h2>
<p> Today is Monday. </p>
<p>My favorite color is <span style="color:purple">purple</span>.</p>
<p>Or maybe <span style="color:lightblue">light blue</span>.</p>
<ul>

<p> Here are some fruits: apples, oranges, bananas </p>
  
    <li>I like to eat apples</li>
  
    <li>I like to eat oranges</li>
  
    <li>I like to eat bananas</li>
  
</ul>
<p> p.s. most of the things on this page are a lie.</p>
